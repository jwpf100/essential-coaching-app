                worked with Nikki over a six-week
                period. The coaching experience made me feel accountable for
                my
                actions, and I was able to identify small steps within my power to control and quickly began to
                feel like I was
                moving forward and creating change.</p>

          <p class="blog-trailer text-muted">Coaching can seem a bit of a dark art and it's hard to know whether
            or not
            a
            careers coach
            is right for you. At the very least it's a space to experiment, practice and learn about yourself with
            someone
            who will hold you accountable to action and give you immediate feedback.</p>

          <p class="blog-trailer text-muted">One of the most important things to find out when you’re searching
            for a
            coach is
            whether or not you think you’ll work well with them. A good coach will be clear with you on
            their style and ways of working so that you can decide whether or not you’ll be a
            good fit. </p>
