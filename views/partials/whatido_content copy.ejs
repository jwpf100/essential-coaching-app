    What I do
    Career coaching for professionals who want to create a career they love
    My three-step programme will help you make the most of your talents and unique skills. Whether you’re working for an
    organisation, running your own gig or you’re in transition, I will draw on my behavioural change expertise to help you kickstart your
    journey to a happier, more fulfilled career. Each of my clients is unique and has differing requirements but broadly, we work through
    the following stages:
     In the ‘Discover’ phase, we’ll get clear on your goals, mindset, values and strengths. This is all about who you are and what
    makes you tick. What’s your vision for the future? What’s your dream?
     In ‘Design’, we’ll spend time defining what’s important to you, exploring your options and what might be holding you back.
    We’ll create a plan of action and you’ll be clear on your next steps.
     ‘Disrupt’ is all about taking action! What are you going to do differently? You’ll be taking positive action to build habits and
    test your ideas and work towards your goals.
    Typically, I work with clients over 6-10 sessions; dependent on what you’re looking to achieve through coaching.

    coaching and explore how I can help you.
    What you’ll get
    Whilst each coaching programme is personalised and tailored to you, they typically include:
     One-to-one, action-oriented 1-hour coaching sessions over a minimum period of 6 weeks.
     A unique, valuable blend of coaching, psychology and behavioural change insight.
     Clear goal setting and measurement of progress against these.
     Structured insight into your strengths and values, which will act as your guiding light for any decisions you make.
     Resources and exercises to accelerate your progress.
     Accountability to build positive habits and achieve your goals.
     A summary email of key points after each coaching session.
     Email/WhatsApp support between coaching sessions.

    Nikki’s coaching was great; so useful in making me think more critically about my decisions/actions for the future. Nikki was really
good at provoking thoughts about my direction that I hadn’t considered without the prompt.

How I work
I’m based in South West London but all of my coaching conversations are currently conducted over Zoom. I am flexible with timings
during the week and coach during the day and evening.
